1. It is similar to singly linked list , with a d/f that in circular linked list last node points to the first node not to the null.
2. Instead of head , we keep track using the last node in circular linked list.

3. It's implementation is as follow-->

public class CircularLinkedList {
	
	private ListNode last;
	private int length;
	
	private class ListNode{
		private ListNode next;
		private int data; //it can be generic also
		
		public ListNode(int data) {
			this.data = data;
			this.next = null;
		}
	}
	
	public CircularLinkedList() {
		last = null;
		length = 0;
	}
	
	public int length() {
		return length;
	}
	
	public boolean isEmpty() {
		return length == 0;
	}
